<h1 class="block">Winter is terrible</h1>

<blockquote id="sylvs" cite="https://aestheticsjournal.com/feature/the-impact-of-winter-on-the-skin">
	 <p>Cold weather, especially cold wind during these periods, combined with increased use of central heating has a drying effect on the skin. Even people with ‘normal’ skin will notice this change – perhaps experiencing red cheeks, taut skin and cracked lips. For people with dry skin conditions, the change can often be enough to cause increased incidences of flare-ups.</p>

<h6 class="intro">It’s the middle of November and all your professors are trying to jam in all of the assignments they forgot to give you because the semester is nearly over. You’re probably either getting a cold or getting over one, and your crush just got cuffed. The only thing drier than your social life is your skin. Here’s how disguise the fact you’re one missed class away from losing your scholarship..</h6>

		<h3 id="skin">Skincare</h3>
			<p class ="ah">Log into your parents <a href="amazon.com">Amazon</a> prime account or sprint to the nearest drugstore. First things first, we need to get rid of the shedding of your skin, your freshman year friends may have been snakes but your skin shouldn’t emulate their questionable personalities. Meet your new best friend: <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Cortizone-10-Maximum-Strength-Hydrocortisone-Anti-Itch-Ointment-1-Oz/10307669?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=0&wl13=5293&adid=22222222227028186680&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=c&wl3=46972332152&wl4=pla-57785562106&wl5=9067609&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&wl9=pla&wl10=8175035&wl11=local&wl12=10307669&veh=sem&gclid=Cj0KCQiAiNnuBRD3ARIsAM8Kmls0ydDn5BKMg_TKpr1zPizgC2oHbS_3BjvXDGYzMvo-imTepGp6BxEaAm0gEALw_wcB">Cortizone-10 ointment</a>. This 5 dollar tube will cure your eczema, chapped lips, irritated nose and your newly developed dermatillomania. This mild steroid is light years ahead of the overpriced vaseline in a millennial pink tube.</p>
	<p class="ah">The next thing you need is trash the walnut shell razorblade exfoliant you’ve been forcing into your pores since you hit puberty. Physical exfoliants may temporarily get rid of the flakes, but all you’re really doing is creating micro cuts and allowing bacteria to enter causing breakouts. Invest in an AHA or BHA solution, like <a href="https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/la-roche-posay-effaclar-clarifying-solution-with-salicylic-acid-acne-toner/ID=prod6239505-product">La Roche-Posay Effaclar Clarifying Solution,</a> which is available online and at certain drugstores (Like Duane Reade) for 15 dollars. This dual acid toner will both exfoliate dead skin cells, stimulate collagen, and fight bacteria deep within the pores. </p>
	<p class="ah">If you’re looking for a moisturizer that doesn’t clog your pores but lasts longer than your studio class, try <a href="https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/avene-skin-recovery-cream/ID=prod6193057-product">Avène Thermal Skin Recovery Cream </a>(Available online and at Duane Reade) This fragrance and alcohol-free moisturizer calms winter redness, aids in preventing stress-relating aging, and soothes even the worst hangover breakouts. This moisturizer is 35 dollars but will last until the city smells like warm trash again.</p>
	<p class="ah">Get a warm humidifier. The forced dry heat can make basic functions like breathing more difficult. Humidifiers put moisture into the air, so if you’re going to sleep with a stuffy nose and waking up with a dry mouth: this is your solution to breathing again. Dry heat can also wreak havoc on the skin, leading to breakouts and misery, the humidifier will help keep your skin dewy.</p>

		We are not prejudiced against sweatpants, but if you’re trying to impress the fashion majors without getting frostbite, we recommend heattech clothing. Hop over to <a href="https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/women/heattech-collection?gclid=Cj0KCQiAiNnuBRD3ARIsAM8KmluHosW_FKnN-t-RhCIRpgsZfWNF4AkiOHoTn-UwziL3-V9P6s2-tjIaAgN7EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds">Uniqlo</a> in Soho and get yourself thermal shirts, glitter tights, scoop-back bodysuits, long johns, jeans and suits. We also recommend fleece tights, which are available on Amazon. This is an easy way to merge summer-sale buys with the drastic drop in temperature. <p>
				<p class="ooh">If you’re getting annoyed at the one warm winter coat you got 3 years ago, we recommend <a href="https://www.aritzia.com/us/en/the-super-puff">Aritzia’s super-puff</a>, available in a multitude of colors, lengths and styles. This coat will last a long time and spice up any outfit while protecting your body. <p> </div>
