        I'm from Palo Alto, California, but have lived in NYC for the last 4 years. The dichotomy between the laid-back Bay Area and New York City's constant drivel was difficult to grow accustom to;but since I've spent most of my formative years in the city, I've learned to enjoy the constant noise and find complete silence vaguely unsettling. I am a journalism and design major, but also enjoy painting. I enjoy learning, reading, having a good laugh, seeing my friends, and going to sleep. I read and I write quite often, currently I am reading <i>Guilty by David Baldacci</i> I read one of Baldacci's books on vacation and found him to be an entertaining writer, not a profound one, but still has interesting and engaging books. I often write short stories about personal experiences, and poetry (sometimes)
